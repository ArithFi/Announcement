# ArithFi Copy Trading Rules

ArithFi Copy Trade Profit Sharing feature is live, where traders can share the profits from copy trading. Below are the rules and settlement details of profit sharing.

1. The system will calculate the profit and loss for each copied order and add them up during the settlement.
2. When closing the position, the system will pre-deduct 10% of the profit for each profitable order. On the day of profit sharing settlement, if the total pre-deduct profit sharing > trader's actual profit sharing, the excess will be refunded to the followerâ€™s account.
3. Profit sharing only occurs when both the follower and trader close their copied orders. The settlement date will not be carried out until all copied orders are closed.
4. The settlement cycle of the copy trading system is once every 7 days. Profit sharing will be calculated every Monday at 00:00 (UTC+8).
5. Daily P&L update time: 00:00 (UTC+8), orders opened after this time will be counted in the next P&L calculation cycle

The update above will be completed on 2023-10-20 17:00 ( UTC+8).
