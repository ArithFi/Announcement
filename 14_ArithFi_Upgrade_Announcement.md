Official Announcement: Revised ATF Token Distribution for ArithFi

We are excited to announce a significant revision to the tokenomics of ArithFi. To better align with our strategic goals and enhance the governance structure, we have updated the total supply and distribution model of ATF tokens.

New ATF Token Distribution:

Total Supply: Reduced to 100 million tokens.
- System Reserves(Locked for settlement): 65 million tokens.
- Team and Early Contributors: 5 million tokens.
- Investors: 5 million tokens.
- DAO Fund: 25 million tokens.

Previous ATF Token Distribution:

Total Supply: 1 billion tokens.
- System Reserves(Locked for settlement): 500 million tokens.
- Team and Early Contributors: 150 million tokens.
- Investors: 200 million tokens.
- DAO Fund: 150 million tokens.

This update represents a strategic shift towards a more sustainable and community-focused model. The new structure not only reduces the overall token supply but also reallocates resources to ensure long-term development and community engagement.

We believe these changes will enhance the value of ArithFi tokens and provide a solid foundation for the future growth of our ecosystem. We appreciate your support and trust as we continue to evolve and strengthen ArithFi's position in the market.

Thank you for being a part of our journey.
